# Patient-Satisfaction-Prediction-using-Health-Information-Systems-Data
This project explores the impact of Health Information Systems (HIS) on patient satisfaction using real-world survey data. A multiple linear regression model is built to identify which healthcare service factors—such as doctor communication, hygiene, appointment management, and diagnostic accuracy—most influence patient satisfaction scores.

# Overview

This project explores how digital tools in healthcare—like appointment systems, communication with doctors, lab services, and diagnostics—affect patient satisfaction. Using a real-world dataset, I built a **regression model** to understand which aspects of a healthcare system contribute most to a positive patient experience.

The goal is to apply data science to uncover valuable insights into how Health Information Systems (HIS) can be improved to support more patient-centered care.

## 🛠️ Tools & Technologies

- Python (Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, scikit-learn)
- Jupyter Notebook
- Dataset: [Patient Satisfaction Survey (Kaggle)](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/vdimitrievska/patient-satisfaction-dataset/data)

## 📌 How to Run

## Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/Patient-Satisfaction-HIS.git

   cd Patient-Satisfaction-HIS

   pip install pandas numpy matplotlib scikit-learn
