# Patient-Satisfaction-Prediction-using-Health-Information-Systems-Data
This project explores the impact of Health Information Systems (HIS) on patient satisfaction using real-world survey data. A multiple linear regression model is built to identify which healthcare service factors—such as doctor communication, hygiene, appointment management, and diagnostic accuracy—most influence patient satisfaction scores.
✨ Overview

This project explores how digital tools in healthcare—like appointment systems, communication with doctors, lab services, and diagnostics—affect patient satisfaction. Using a real-world dataset, I built a **regression model** to understand which aspects of a healthcare system contribute most to a positive patient experience.

The goal is to apply data science to uncover valuable insights into how Health Information Systems (HIS) can be improved to support more patient-centered care.
